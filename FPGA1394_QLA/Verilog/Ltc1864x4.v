 * Module: LTC1864x4
 *
 * Purpose: Reads data from a group of 4 LTC2601 set up with common
 *          conv & sclk inputs and providing 4 discrete data outputs.
 *
 * Theory of operation:
 *     Conversion is initiated by taking the conv line high for at least
 *     4.66 us, followed by taking conv low and clocking out the 16-bit
 *     data. Data is sampled by the Sample & Hold while conv is low.
 *     The value is latched at the rising edge of conv and the data
 *     is converted over the next 4.66 us. During this time the clock
 *     is supposed to be static.
 *
 *     The above is implemented by having a free running counter that
 *     counts from 0 to 0x67 and then rolls over. The conv signal is
 *     low for the first 0x22 counts and high for the remaining 0x46.
 *
 *     sclk is high by default. After providing a setup time for conv
 *     sclk pulses low for a clock following counts 2 4 6......0x22,
 *     resulting in 16 pulses.
 *
 *     The incoming data is continuously shifted into 4 shift registers
 *     on every other count.
 *
 *     On the 0x23 count, the value of the shift registers is latched
 *     as the latest A2D value for the respective channel.
